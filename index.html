  <p>ReelWomenNYC is an all-female production company devoted to providing solid and relatable entertainment for 
	  New Yorkers  (and people who just love New York). <br>

We all know the daily trials of city life, be it the subway, your love life, or just waiting in line at Starbucks. 
	  We hope that our work helps you to not only deal with these seemingly unbearable moments, 
	  but even learn to laugh at them.<br>

May the luck of the city be ever with you!
