		<div><strong>Denise Ivanoff</strong> is a New York-based actress who also sings, dances, writes, directs, and plays the piano. When not doing those things (which isn't often) she can be found coding websites, reading philosophy, studying abstract math, learning foreign languages, participating in cyber-attacks on inhumane governments, wine-tasting, and playing with dogs, all in 5-inch heels.</div>

	<img src="Julie.jpg" width="300px">
		<div><strong>Julie McNamara </strong>is an NYC-based singer, actress, and improviser who is thrilled to be collaborating with these amazing ladies!  She is trained in improv and musical improv at the Magnet Theater. When Julie is not singing, dancing, or thinking she's saying hilarious things, you can find her in the yoga studio either leading a practice or finding her own zen. That is, if she's not too busy finishing a large ice cream sundae- with sprinkles of course.</div>
